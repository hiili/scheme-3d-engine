Scheme 3D Engine + maze game
============================

A 3D engine with dynamic lighting, written in Scheme. It runs smoothly even on low-spec hardware like the SGI O2 (without using the GPU chip), which is possible mainly due to on-the-fly caching of the contribution of stopped light sources, and to assuming planar maps (in the sense of Wolfenstein 3D). A maze game that uses the engine is included.
